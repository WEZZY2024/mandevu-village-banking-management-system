      <h2>What is village Banking ?</h2>
      <div class="about-text">
        <p>
          " Village banking is a way for people who know and trust each
          other(like friends,coworkers , or neighbors) to save and borrow money
          together , without needing a bank. A typical group has 5 to 10
          members.They set their own rules, elect leaders , and meet once in a
          week normally a friday to give out loans , track repayments and track
          there savings.Everyone contributes , and members can apply for loans
          from the group's shared savings. At the end of the cycle (usually 12
          months) members get back their savings plus a share of the interest
          earned .The more you save and credit the more you earn."
        </p>
        <p>
          " Traditionally , all of this is tracked using notebooks , cash boxes
          , or spreadsheets - but that comes with risk and confusion .Chimunzi
          digitizes it all: saving , lending , record-keeping, and payouts,
          securely from your phone in the comfort of your home."
